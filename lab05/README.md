# Lab 05 — RPI Workflow: GitHub MCP, HVE & Coding Agent

**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**SDLC Phase:** Plan → Implement  
**Autonomy Level:** 🔴 Agent acts autonomously, human reviews & approves  
**Prerequisites:** Lab 04 completed, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, [HVE Core](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core) or [HVE Core All](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core-all) extension

---

## Learning Objective

Experience the full **RPI (Research → Plan → Implement)** workflow powered by agents that are connected to real tools — the GitHub MCP server, HVE experiences, and the Coding Agent. By the end you will have directed an autonomous agent to research a live GitHub repo, plan work against it, and implement changes — all without leaving VS Code.

## The Exercise Repository

All exercises in this lab use the **octocat-supply-copilot-demo** as your working codebase:

> **https://github.com/colindembovsky/octocat-supply-copilot-demo**

This is a realistic supply-chain application that demonstrates GitHub Copilot features across the full development lifecycle. You will **fork it** so the Coding Agent can open PRs against your own copy.

---

## Setup

### 1 — Add the GitHub MCP server

In VS Code open your user or workspace `settings.json` and add:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verify the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set (it is pre-configured in this dev container). Restart the MCP server via the **MCP: Restart Server** command palette entry, then confirm the `github` server shows a green dot in the MCP panel.

### 2 — Fork & clone the exercise repo

```bash
# Fork via GitHub CLI then clone your fork
gh repo fork colindembovsky/octocat-supply-copilot-demo --clone --remote
cd octocat-supply-copilot-demo
```

Open the cloned folder in VS Code (`code .`). This is the codebase you will research, modify, and raise PRs against for the rest of the lab.

### 3 — Confirm HVE Core is active

Open the Extensions view and verify **HVE Core** is installed and enabled. You should see HVE agents available in the Chat agent picker (`@hve`).

## Part 1 — Demo: octocat-supply-copilot-demo (15 min)

Walk through the key Copilot features demonstrated in the reference repo. The goal is to understand *how* the demo is structured so you can apply the same patterns in your own projects.

### Your tasks

1. **Feature inventory.** Ask Chat:
   ```
   Using MCP, read the docs/ folder in colindembovsky/octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Create a table of every Copilot feature the demo showcases, what part of
   the codebase demonstrates it, and which SDLC phase it belongs to.
   ```

2. **Pick an open issue to work on.** Ask Chat:
   ```
   Using MCP, list the open issues in my fork of octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Recommend the best one to tackle as a first contribution — something
   self-contained, clearly scoped, and representative of the codebase.
   ```
   Note the issue number. You will use it in Parts 3 and 4.

3. **Compare agent outputs.** Run the same prompt twice — once with the GitHub MCP server active, once without (disable it temporarily in settings). Compare the depth and accuracy of the two responses.

   > **Discussion:** When does grounding with MCP tools matter most?

### Takeaway
You now have a real issue scoped and a research summary in hand. The rest of the lab drives this issue all the way to a merged PR.

---

## Part 2 — Connect Agents to the GitHub MCP Server (10 min)

The GitHub MCP server exposes tools like `search_repositories`, `get_file_contents`, `list_issues`, `create_issue`, and `create_pull_request` directly to Chat agents. This is what makes agents **grounded** in your actual GitHub context instead of relying solely on model knowledge.

### Your tasks

1. **Verify tool availability.** In Copilot Chat, type:
   ```
   What GitHub tools do you have access to right now?
   ```
   You should see a list of MCP-provided tools (search, issues, PRs, code, etc.).

2. **Explore the repo structure.** Ask:
   ```
   Using the GitHub MCP tools, fetch the README and list the top-level
   directories of my fork of octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Summarise what the application does and its tech stack.
   ```
   The agent will call `get_file_contents` and `list_directory` live — watch the tool call annotations in Chat.

3. **Fetch the issue you chose in Part 1.** Ask:
   ```
   Fetch issue #<number> from my fork of octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Identify every file likely involved in the fix and explain why.
   ```

4. **Read the relevant source files.** Ask:
   ```
   Fetch the files you identified and summarise the current implementation.
   What is missing or broken relative to the issue description?
   ```

### Takeaway
When an agent has MCP tools, it can **act on real data** rather than hallucinating structure. The GitHub MCP server turns Chat into a live interface to your repositories.

## Part 3 — HVE Collection (15 min)

**Hypervelocity Engineering (HVE) Core** ([github.com/microsoft/hve-core](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core)) is Microsoft's open-source prompt library for GitHub Copilot. It ships 49 specialised agents, 102 auto-applied coding instructions, 63 reusable prompts, and 11 skills — all tuned for convention-driven, RPI-style engineering workflows. Once installed, agents activate automatically in Copilot Chat; there is no extra configuration.

### Install

Two extensions are available — pick one:

| Extension | Artifacts | Best for |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| [HVE Core](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core) | 41 (flagship RPI collection) | Getting started with RPI workflows |
| [HVE Core All](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core-all) | 221 (all domains) | Full library access |

**VS Code:**
1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search **HVE Core** (publisher: `ise-hve-essentials`) and click **Install**.
3. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`) and type `@` — HVE agents appear in the picker immediately.

**GitHub Copilot CLI (alternative):**
```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/hve-core
copilot plugin install hve-core@hve-core
```

> Full documentation: **<https://microsoft.github.io/hve-core/>**

### Key agents used in this lab

| Agent | RPI phase | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `task-researcher` | Research | Deep-reads a task or codebase area; produces a structured research report before any code is written |
| `rpi-agent` | R → P → I | Drives the full Research → Plan → Implement cycle; pauses for human approval between phases |
| `pr-reviewer` | Review | Fetches a PR diff and produces a structured review covering correctness, security, test coverage, and style |
| `memory` | All | Persists agent findings across sessions so context is not lost between conversations |

See the full [Agents Reference](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/.github/CUSTOM-AGENTS.md) for all 49 agents.

### Your tasks

1. **Research the issue with `rpi-agent`.** In Chat with the GitHub MCP server active:
   ```
   @hve /rpi-agent
   Issue #<number> in my fork of octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Fetch the issue and all relevant source files via MCP.
   Research the problem thoroughly, produce a detailed implementation plan,
   then implement the fix.
   ```
   Watch the three phases: **Research** (agent fetches files) → **Plan** (agent proposes steps, pauses for approval) → **Implement** (agent writes code).

2. **Review the plan before implementation.** After the Research phase the agent will present a plan. Check it covers:
   - The correct files identified
   - Edge cases mentioned in the issue
   - Tests that need updating or adding
   
   Approve the plan to let the agent proceed, or ask it to revise specific steps.

3. **Capture the research as a prompt file.**
   After the run, ask:
   ```
   Save the research findings as a reusable prompt file at
   .github/copilot/prompts/issue-<number>-research.prompt.md
   ```
   This preserves the context for future reviewers or follow-up work.

### Takeaway
HVE agents enforce a **research-first discipline**. They read before they write, plan before they implement. This dramatically reduces hallucination and increases the quality of agent-generated changes.

## Part 4 — Coding Agent End-to-End (20 min)

The **Coding Agent** is the highest-autonomy mode: given a GitHub Issue, it autonomously reads the codebase, plans changes, implements them, runs tests, and opens a PR — all without step-by-step human guidance.

### Your tasks

1. **Create a new issue in your fork.** Using the GitHub MCP tools from Chat:
   ```
   Create a GitHub issue in my fork of octocat-supply-copilot-demo.
   Title: "Add low-stock alert when inventory falls below reorder threshold"
   Body: When a product's quantity drops below its reorder_threshold,
   the system should emit a low-stock alert event. Add the logic and
   a unit test covering the threshold boundary.
   ```
   Note the issue number returned.

2. **Assign the issue to the Coding Agent.**
   - Open the issue on GitHub.com (or via the GitHub Pull Requests extension).
   - Assign it to **@github-copilot**.
   - Alternatively, in Chat:
     ```
     Assign issue #<number> in my fork to github-copilot using the MCP tools.
     ```

3. **Watch the agent work.** The Coding Agent will:
   - Read the relevant source files and tests in the forked repo
   - Implement the low-stock alert logic
   - Write or update tests
   - Open a draft PR linked to the issue

4. **Review and approve.** When the PR appears:
   - Use `@hve /pr-reviewer` to review it
   - Request any changes via PR comments — the Coding Agent will respond and push updates
   - Approve and merge when satisfied

5. **Reflect.** Ask Chat:
   ```
   What did the Coding Agent do well? What would a human developer
   have done differently? Where would you add a human checkpoint
   in this workflow for production use?
   ```

### Takeaway
The Coding Agent collapses the Research → Plan → Implement loop into a **single intent statement** (the issue). Your role shifts from implementer to reviewer and approver — this is the RPI workflow at its highest autonomy level.
